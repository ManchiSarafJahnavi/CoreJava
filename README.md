Title: Online Ticket Booking System

Description:
The Online Ticket Booking System is a Java-based project designed to facilitate the booking of tickets for various events such as concerts, movies, and conferences. This project allows users to register, log in, view available events, select events to book tickets, and pay for their bookings. Key features include user authentication, event management, ticket reservation, and payment processing (simulation).

This system provides a command-line interface for user interaction and incorporates object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity. Users can register accounts, log in securely, browse available events, select the desired number of tickets, and view the total amount to be paid before proceeding to payment.

The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Java programming, including classes, objects, collections, user input handling, and basic control flow. It serves as an educational resource for learning Java programming and software development practices.

Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the functionality, usability, and maintainability of the Online Ticket Booking System project.
